Now, to integrate the DIYBlog app into your project, clone the repository by running:</p> <p><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/DjangoDIY/diyblog.git\n</code></pre> This will download the DIYBlog app into your current directory. The next step is to move the app into your Django project. Navigate to the diyblog directory:</p> <p><pre><code>cd diyblog\n</code></pre> Inside this directory, you\u2019ll find the app\u2019s source code in a subdirectory named diyblog.
